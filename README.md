# On-a-bayesian-change-point-detection-model-for-multivariate-data

This project cointains all the code that we used for a Bayesian project named "on a bayesian change point detection model for multivariate data", which tackles the problem of change point detection in multivariate time series using a Bayesian approach.
The work is explained deeply in the Report file.

functions.R file contains all the auxiliary functions needed for the algorithm.
*_parameters.R files cointain all the parameters used for a specific experiment *

there are 3 *_main.R files, each of them cointains our analysis on a specific topic, using our algorithm. In each of those, we load all functions and parameters.

All the code is commented for a easier read.
